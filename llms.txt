# lifx-async

> A modern, type-safe, async Python library for controlling LIFX lights

lifx-async is a modern, type-safe, async Python library for controlling LIFX smart devices
over the local network. Built with Python's built-in asyncio for async/await patterns and
features auto-generated protocol structures from a YAML specification.

Key features:
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Full async/await support with asyncio
- Type-safe with strict Pyright validation
- Auto-generated protocol from official LIFX specification
- Supports all LIFX device types: Light, HevLight, InfraredLight, MultiZoneLight, and TileDevice
- High-level API with device discovery and batch operations
- Concurrent request handling with connection pooling
